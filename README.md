============
Genre = 2D Space

It would be realistic, for example a power conduit connected to the main generator and shields gets shot and the shields no longer work and there may be risk of getting zapped by the conduit
So you have multiple people running around the ship who may fix it or man turrets or something
It is a very teambased system where a team is pitted against another team. (Fleet Battles)
